Crypto analyzer by M_Vlasov.

Program implements Caesar cipher. It works in 4 modes:
1. Encrypts text file by Caesar cipher with known shift number.
2. Decodes encrypted file with known shift number.
3. Brute forces encrypted file. Creates understandable text. Shows shift number with which file was encrypted.
4. Analyzes encrypted file by collecting statistics of each symbol occurs, compares to reference file and builds decoded text. Due low accuracy of the methodology this mode includes correction mode where any two symbols can be swapped. 

Program works with russian alphabet. Can be easily adjusted for any alphabet.
Program is ready for console application.
