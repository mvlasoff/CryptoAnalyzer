Console application implementation Caesar cipher text encryption and decoding. It works in 4 modes:
1. Encrypts text file by Caesar cipher with known shift number.
2. Decodes encrypted file with known shift number.
3. Brute forces encrypted file. Decodes and shows shift number.
4. Analyzes encrypted file by collecting statistics of each symbol occurs, compares to reference file and builds decoded text. This mode includes correction mode where any two symbols can be swapped.
